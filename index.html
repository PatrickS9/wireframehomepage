  BRIEF HISTORY OF SAINT LOUIS SCHOOL OF AURORA HILL

  Saint Louis School of Aurora Hill, Inc. first opened its door for a course to the youth in June 1968. It was established to complement and enhance the church's mission
  evangelization through the quality Christian education.
  Located at the building of lmmaculate Conception Church ,the school occupies the three lower floors of the building. The church was inaugurated though in August 1965.
  <br>
  June 1968: The school was formally opened, with
  Rev. Fr. Albert Van Pelt as the school director and parish
  priest with Sr. Carmel Fianza as the first school principal. The initial enrollees for first year were 25 boys and girls. On its second year there were 34 1irst years and 28 second years. On the third year, Miss Felomena Asejo became the principal of the 18 first years, 31 second years and 31 third years. The school gained its Government Recognition as a
  Secondary Education Institution from DECS in school year
  <br>
  1971-1972 with Mrs. Nellie Macadangdang- Olairez (Now
  Atty. Nellie M. Olairez) as the new principal of41 first years, 27 second years, 43 third years and 37 fourth years. Of the 37 fourth years, 35 became pioneer graduates of the school. The subsequent years saw the increase in student population and
  changes of the administration.
  1976-1980: Rev. Fr. Sotero Gayawet, as the School Director. He tailored improvements in the classrooms and the library of the school.
  <br>
  1981-1984: Rev. Fr. Patricio Guyguyon, as the School Director. During his time, the school facilities were renewed, new cite for flag ceremony was installed within the school
  premises, cemented blocks on the church's frontage too, was built
  <br>
  1985-1998: Rev. Fr. Pedro Rulloda, the school director then, instigated the improvement of the comfort
  rooms and setting up the basement accommodating two classrooms. No one will forget the killer earthquake that Baguio in July 16, 1990, which caused major damages to
  You sent Today at 5:08 PM
  many school buildings. However, the strong foundation of our church and school building was able to withstand the tragedy with minor damages and classes were resumed on September on the same year.
  <br>
  1998-2003: Rev. Fr. Manny A. Castro, JCD was the school Director Great improvement on the physical set up of
  the school was seen. It was during his time that the school playground was cemented and the spacious comfort rooms for boys and girls were constructed. There were renovations
  and great improvement with the offices, classrooms, and the
  computer Laboratory. All these improvements of the physical
  plants were realized through the effort of the school director.
  <br>
  Furthermore in 2000-2001, SLSAH placed first in
  Religion Quiz Bee, sponsored by the Knights of Columbus of
  Baguio, second in 2001-2002 in the same event. In "CHEMAPHY" quiz bee sponsored by AMA Computer
  College of Baguio, SLSAH ranked fifth place of the 15 participating schools, from both public and private. Our
  athletes had also shown their physical fitness and sportsmanship during interschool competitions, City District
  meets and others. They garnered victories and at the same time defeat makes them grow and mature as a person.

  Saint Aloysius belonged to a family of princes, theGonzaga tamily. wheh he had his first communion, he made
  You sent Today at 5:18 PM
  up his mind to make God his first and last love. He was thirteen years old when his father, together with his brother, took him from Italy, where he was born, to King Philip's court in Spain. James, the king's son, made Aloysius and his brother his pages.
  <br>
  Two ycars later, Prince James died and Aloysius returned to Italy. By this time he decided to give up his royal title of prince in favor of his brother. Why? He wanted to be a prince of God. His mother consented to his choice of religious vocation but his father opposed it. His father wanted him to be a soldier and a great ruler but Aloysius wanted to be a soldier
  of God.
  <br>
  And yet with a determined will, he finally got his father's consent and in the year 1585 on the 25th of November he entered the Jesuit Order as a novice, thus moving his first step toward his holy ambition. With the hope to be a missionary and to work among the pagans, he worked and prayed fervently and unceasingly.
  <br>
  When he was about to be ordained as a priest in Rome, an epidemic suddenly swept the city. The Jesuits stopped their school and put up a hospital. Aloysius and the other
  seminarians helped took care of the sick. Eventually because of direct contact with the aflicted, Aloysius got the plague. Soon he was ill unto death. It was the 2Ist day of June 1591, eight days after the feast of Corpus Christi. He was 23 years
  old and had lived in the seminary for more than five years.
  <br>
  The young saint, a model and patron of boys and young men, preferred to be a religious poor rather than to
  enjoy a luxurious life of a prince. Teenagers of modern times certainly do need Aloysius badly as a model and a guide to the ways of Christ.
  <br>
  In the year of 1726, Pope Benedict XIII proclaimed Aloysius Gonzaga a saint, thus the Holy Church proclaimed publicly the marvelous heroism ofAloysius (Louis) Gonzaga
  during the brief 23 years that he graced this earth, the heroism and the cooperation with God's grace by which he merited the eternal friendship of God. Having served the world, he found heaven; having left his kinsmen and friends, he found God.
